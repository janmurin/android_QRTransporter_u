'''QR code''' (abbreviated from '''Quick Response Code''') is the trademark for a type of [[matrix barcode]] (or two-dimensional [[barcode]]) first designed for the [[automotive industry in Japan]]. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte / binary, and [[kanji]]) to efficiently store data; extensions may also be used.<ref name=QRCodefeatures>{{cite web |url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrfeature.html |title=QR Code features |publisher=Denso-Wave |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrfeature.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

The QR Code system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcodes]]. Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacs.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=D1FpVAvvJuo%3D&tabid=1426&mid=4802 |title=QR Code Essentials |publisher=Denso ADC |year= 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

A QR code consists of black modules (square dots) arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device (such as a camera, scanner, etc.) and processed using [[Reed–Solomon]] error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

== History ==

The QR code system was invented in 1994 by [[Denso]] Wave. Its purpose was to track vehicles during manufacture; it was designed to allow high-speed component scanning.<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Augmented Reality |author=Borko Furht |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fG8JUdrScsYC&lpg=PP1&dq=Handbook%20of%20Augmented%20Reality&pg=PA341 |page=341 |publisher=Springer |year=2011|isbn=9781461400646 }}</ref> Although initially used for tracking parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes now are used in a much broader context, including both commercial tracking applications and convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile-phone users (termed mobile tagging). QR codes may be used to display text to the user, to add a [[vCard]] contact to the user's device, to open a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI), or to compose an e-mail or text message. Users can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several paid and free QR code generating sites or apps. The technology has since become one of the most-used types of two-dimensional barcode.<ref name=About2DCode>{{cite web |url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/aboutqr.html |title=QR Code&nbsp;— About 2D Code |publisher=Denso-Wave |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.qrcode.com/en/aboutqr.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

== Standards ==
[[File:QR Code Structure Example 3.svg|right|400px|Structure of a QR code, highlighting functional elements]]
There are several standards that cover the encoding of data as QR codes:<ref name="qrstandard1">{{cite web |url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrstandard.html |title=QR Code Standardization |publisher=Denso-Wave |work=QR Code.com |accessdate=23 April 2009 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrstandard.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

== Uses ==
[[File:Japan-qr-code-billboard.jpg|thumb|A QR code used on a large billboard in Japan, linking to the sagasou.mobi website]]
QR codes have become common in consumer advertising. Typically, a [[smartphone]] is used as a QR code scanner, displaying the code and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard [[URL]] for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a [[web browser]]).
The QR code has become a focus of [[advertising]] strategy, since it provides a way to access a brand's website more quickly than by manually entering a URL.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/software-technology/11930.html |title=http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/software-technology/11930.html |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120912/http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/news/software-technology/11930.html |archivedate=2012-09-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/01/04/tescos-cool-qr-code-advertising-campaign/ |title=http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/01/04/tescos-cool-qr-code-advertising-campaign/ |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120720/http://blogs.vancouversun.com/2012/01/04/tescos-cool-qr-code-advertising-campaign/ |archivedate=2012-07-20}}</ref> Beyond mere convenience to the consumer, the importance of this capability is that it increases the [[conversion rate]] (the chance that contact with the advertisement will convert to a sale), by coaxing interested prospects further down the [[conversion funnel]] with little delay or effort, bringing the viewer to the advertiser's website immediately, where a longer and more targeted sales pitch may lose the viewer's interest.

Although initially used to track parts in vehicle manufacturing, QR codes are now ({{as of | 2012 | lc = on}}) used over a much wider range of applications, including commercial tracking, entertainment and transport ticketing, product/loyalty marketing (examples: mobile couponing where a company's discounted and percent discount can be captured using a QR code decoder which is a mobile app, or storing a company's information such as address and related information alongside its alpha-numeric text data as can be seen in Yellow Pages directory), and in-store product labeling. It can also be used in storing personal information for use by organizations. An example of this is Philippines National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) where NBI clearances now come with a QR code. Many of these applications target [[mobile phone|mobile-phone]] users (via [[mobile tagging]]). Users may receive text, add a [[vCard]] contact to their device, open a URI, or compose an [[email#Message format|e-mail]] or text message after scanning QR codes. They can generate and print their own QR codes for others to scan and use by visiting one of several pay or free QR code-generating sites or apps. [[Google]] had a popular [[API]] to generate QR codes,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://code.google.com/apis/chart/infographics/ | title=Google Chart Tools |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120707/http://code.google.com/apis/chart/infographics/ |archivedate=2012-07-07}}</ref> and apps for scanning QR codes can be found on nearly all smartphone devices.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.708media.com/qrcode/qr-code-readers-iphone-android-blackberry-windows-phone-7/ | title=QR Code Readers for iPhone, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone 7 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120718/http://www.708media.com/qrcode/qr-code-readers-iphone-android-blackberry-windows-phone-7/ |archivedate=2012-07-18}}</ref>

QR codes storing addresses and URLs may appear in magazines, on signs, on buses, on business cards, or on almost any object about which users might want information. Users with a [[camera phone]] equipped with the correct reader application can scan the image of the QR code to display text, contact information, connect to a [[wireless LAN|wireless network]], or open a web page in the telephone's browser. This act of linking from physical world objects is termed [[hardlink (hyperlink)|hardlinking]] or [[object hyperlinking]]. QR codes also may be linked to a location to track where a code has been scanned. Either the application that scans the QR code retrieves the geo information by using GPS and cell tower triangulation (aGPS) or the URL encoded in the QR code itself is associated with a location.<ref name=GeotaggedQRCodes>{{cite web |url=http://qrd.by |title=Geo Tagged QR Codes |accessdate=27 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120714/http://qrd.by |archivedate=2012-07-14}}</ref>

In June 2011, The [[Royal Dutch Mint]] (Koninklijke Nederlandse Munt) issued the world's first official coin with a QR code to celebrate the centenary of its current building and premises. The coin can be scanned by a [[smartphone]] and link to a special website with contents about the historical event and design of the coin.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.q5g.nl/|title= World's first QR code coin website |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.q5g.nl/ |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref> In 2014, the Central Bank of Nigeria issued a 100-naira banknote to commemorate the centennial of its existence.

Psychologist [[Richard Wiseman]] was one of the first authors to include QR Codes in a book, in ''Paranormality: Why We See What Isn't There'' (2011), allowing his readers to follow-up on [[paranormal]] claims by accessing his research through the codes.<ref name=Skepicality160>{{cite web|author=Skepticality|url=http://www.skepticality.com/paranormality/|title=Paranormality|publisher=Skepticality.com|date=5 July 2011|accessdate=27 June 2015}}</ref>

=== Mobile operating systems ===

QR codes can be used on various mobile device operating systems. These devices support [[URL redirection]], which allows QR codes to send [[metadata]] to existing applications on the device. Many paid or free apps are available with the ability to scan the codes and hard-link to an external URL.

=== URLs ===

URLs aided [[conversion rate|marketing conversion rates]] even in the pre-smartphone era, but during those years faced several limitations: ad viewers usually had to type the URL and often did not have a web browser in front of them when they first viewed the ad. The chances were high that they would forget to visit the site later, not bother to type a URL, or forget what URL to type. [[Semantic URL]]s decreased these risks but did not eliminate them. Some of these disadvantages to URL conversion rates are fading away now that smartphones are putting web access and voice recognition in constant reach. Thus an advert viewer need only reach for his or her phone and speak the URL, at the moment of ad contact, rather than remember to type it into a PC later.

=== Virtual stores ===

During the month of June 2011, according to one study, 14 million mobile users scanned a QR code or a barcode. Some 58% of those users scanned a QR or barcode from their homes, while 39% scanned from retail stores; 53% of the 14 million users were men between the ages of 18 and 34.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.internetretailing.net/2011/08/14m-americans-scanned-qr-and-bar-codes-with-their-mobiles-in-june-2011/ |title=16 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120906/http://www.internetretailing.net/2011/08/14m-americans-scanned-qr-and-bar-codes-with-their-mobiles-in-june-2011/ |archivedate=2012-09-06}}</ref> The use of QR codes for "virtual store" formats started in South Korea,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop2mobi.com/tesco-qr-code-virtual-store/ |title=Tesco QR Code Virtual Store |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.shop2mobi.com/tesco-qr-code-virtual-store/ |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref> and Argentina,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/Marketing-futurista-comprar-camara-celular_0_555544518.html |title=Marketing futurista: ya se puede comprar con la cámara del celular |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.ieco.clarin.com/empresas/Marketing-futurista-comprar-camara-celular_0_555544518.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref> but is currently expanding globally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-11-phone-friendly-codes-ads.html |title=11 November 2010 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-11-phone-friendly-codes-ads.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref> Walmart, Procter & Gamble and Woolworths have already adopted the Virtual Store concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shop2mobi.com/virtual-qr-code-store-examples/ |title=Top 10 QR Code Store examples |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.shop2mobi.com/virtual-qr-code-store-examples/ |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

=== Code payments ===

QR codes can be used to store bank account information or credit card information, or they can be specifically designed to work with particular payment provider applications. There are several trial applications of QR code payments across the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/12/scvngr-levelup-redo/ |title=SCVNGR Unveils QR Code Payment System }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2012/01/26/mastercard-starts-piloting-qkr-mobile-payment-app/ |title=MasterCard starts piloting QkR mobile payment app }}</ref>

In November 2012, QR code payments were deployed on a larger scale in the [[Czech Republic]] when an open format for payment information exchange - a [[Short Payment Descriptor]] - was introduced and endorsed by the Czech Banking Association as the official local solution for QR payments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.czech-ba.cz/aktivity/standardy/format-pro-sdileni-platebnich-udaju-v-czk-qr-kody |title=Standard No. 26: Format for exchanging the payment information for Czech domestic payments using the QR codes |publisher=Czech Banking Association |date=November 2012 }}</ref>

QR codes are commonly used in the field of cryptographic currencies, particularly those based off and including [[Bitcoin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bitcoin.org/en/faq|title=FAQ - Bitcoin|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> Payment addresses, cryptographic keys and transaction information are often shared between digital wallets in this way.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blockchain.info/wallet/features|title=Blockchain.info - Bitcoin Wallet - Features|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

=== Website login ===

QR codes can be used to log in into websites: a QR Code is shown on the login page on a computer screen, and when a registered user scans it with a verified smartphone, they will automatically be logged in on the computer. Authentication is performed by the smartphone which contacts the server. Google tested such a login method in January 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/security/google-testing-login-authentication-via-qr-codes/10105 |title=Google testing login authentication via QR codes}}</ref>

=== Funerary use ===
In 2008, Ishinokoe in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan began to sell tombstones with QR codes produced by IT DeSign, where the code leads to a virtual grave site of the deceased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j-cast.com/mono/2008/03/20018046.html|title=モノウォッチは生まれ変わります|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantrends.com/qr-code-graves-give-a-memorial-window/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502174456/http://www.japantrends.com/qr-code-graves-give-a-memorial-window/|title=QR code graves give a “Memorial Window”|archivedate=2 May 2012|work=Japan Trends|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobile.ishinokoe.co.jp/|title=供養の窓 - 石の声 株式会社|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> Other companies have begun implementing QR codes into tombstones<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/2011/04/seattle-company-quiring-monuments-adds.html|title=Quiring Monuments adds smartphone codes to gravestones|date=26 April 2011|work=Puget Sound Business Journal|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref> and in 2014 the [[Jewish Cemetery of La Paz]] in Uruguay, began implementing QR codes for tombstones.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/cementerio-judio-se-moderniza-codigos.html |title=Uruguayan Jewish Cemetery QRfied |date=24 March 2014 |publisher=[[El País (Uruguay)|EL PAIS]] |language=es}}</ref>

=== Encryption ===
[[File:Japan Visa with QR code.jpg|thumb|141px|Japanese visa with a QR code (content is not deciphered)]]

Encrypted QR codes, which are not very common, have a few implementations. An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] app,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://market.android.com/details?id=la.droid.qr |title=QR Droid |publisher=Google |date=19 August 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011 }}</ref> for example, manages encryption and decryption of QR codes using the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES algorithm]] (56 bits).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://qrdroid.com/encrypted-qr-codes-share-secret-messages.html |title=Encrypted QR Codes |publisher=QR Droid |date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011 }}</ref> The Japanese immigration system uses encrypted QR codes when issuing visa in passports<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.cliffano.com/2009/05/18/qr-code-usage-in-japan/ |title=QR Code Usage In Japan |publisher=Studio Cliffano |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=18 May 2009 }}</ref> as shown in the figure to the right.

== Design ==

Unlike the older, one-dimensional barcodes that were designed to be mechanically scanned by a narrow beam of light, a QR code is detected by a 2-dimensional digital [[image sensor]] and then digitally analyzed by a programmed processor. The processor locates the three distinctive squares at the corners of the QR code image, using a smaller square (or multiple squares) near the fourth corner to normalize the image for size, orientation, and angle of viewing. The small dots throughout the QR code are then converted to binary numbers and validated with an error-correcting algorithm.

=== Storage ===

The amount of data that can be stored in the QR code symbol depends on the datatype (''mode'', or input character set), version (1, …, 40, indicating the overall dimensions of the symbol), and [[#Error correction|error correction]] level. The maximum storage capacities occur for 40-L symbols (version 40, error correction level L):<ref name=About2DCode/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/vertable1.html |title=Version and Maximum capacity table |publisher=Denso-Wave |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.qrcode.com/en/vertable1.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

=== Error correction ===
[[File:QR Code Damaged.jpg|thumb|141px|Damaged but still decodable QR code]]
[[File:Extreme QR code to Wikipedia mobile page.png|thumb|141px|Example of a QR code with artistic embellishment that will still scan correctly thanks to error correction]]

Codewords are [[Octet (computing)|8 bits]] long and use the [[Reed–Solomon error correction]] algorithm with four error correction levels. The higher the error correction level, the less storage capacity. The following table lists the approximate error correction capability at each of the four levels:

{|
|-
| Level L (Low) || 7% of codewords can be restored.
|-
| Level M (Medium) || 15% of codewords can be restored.
|-
| Level Q (Quartile)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tec-it.com/de/support/knowbase/symbologies/qrcode/Default.aspx |title=2D Barcode: QR-Code |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.tec-it.com/de/support/knowbase/symbologies/qrcode/Default.aspx |archivedate=2012-09-15}} — TEC-IT</ref> || 25% of codewords can be restored.
|-
| Level H (High) || 30% of codewords can be restored.
|}

In larger QR symbols, the message is broken up into several Reed–Solomon code blocks. The block size is chosen so that at most 15 errors can be corrected in each block; this limits the complexity of the decoding algorithm. The code blocks are then interleaved together, making it less likely that localized damage to a QR symbol will overwhelm the capacity of any single block.

Due to error correction, it is possible to create artistic QR codes that still scan correctly, but contain intentional errors to make them more readable or attractive to the human eye, as well as to incorporate colors, logos, and other features into the QR code block.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blog.360i.com/emerging-media/creative-qr-codes | title = Form Meets Function: Extreme Makeover QR Code Edition | author = Orli Sharaby | date = 18 October 2010 | accessdate =29 July 2011  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120708/http://blog.360i.com/emerging-media/creative-qr-codes |archivedate=2012-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://mashable.com/2011/04/18/qr-code-design-tips/ | title = HOW TO: Make Your QR Codes More Beautiful | author = Hamilton Chan | date = 18 April 2011 | accessdate =29 July 2011  |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120710/http://mashable.com/2011/04/18/qr-code-design-tips/ |archivedate=2012-07-10}}</ref>

It is also possible to design artistic QR codes without reducing the error correction capacity by manipulating the underlying mathematical constructs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://research.swtch.com/qart | title = QArt Codes: How to make pictures with QR codes, part II | author = Russ Cox | date = 12 April 2012 | accessdate = 8 May 2015  |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150321031237/http://research.swtch.com/qart |archivedate=2015-03-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://research.swtch.com/qr/draw | title = QArt Coder | author = Russ Cox | date = 12 April 2012 | accessdate = 8 May 2015 }}</ref>

=== Encoding ===

The format information records two things: the error correction level and the mask pattern used for the symbol. Masking is used to break up patterns in the data area that might confuse a scanner, such as large blank areas or misleading features that look like the locator marks. The mask patterns are defined on a grid that is repeated as necessary to cover the whole symbol. Modules corresponding to the dark areas of the mask are inverted. The format information is protected from errors with a [[BCH code]], and two complete copies are included in each QR symbol.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The message dataset is placed from right to left in a zigzag pattern, as shown below. In larger symbols, this is complicated by the presence of the alignment patterns and the use of multiple interleaved error-correction blocks.

Four-bit indicators are used to select the encoding mode and convey other information. Encoding modes can be mixed as needed within a QR symbol.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Encoding modes
! Indicator !! Meaning
|-
| 0001 || Numeric encoding (10 bits per 3 digits)
|-
| 0010 || Alphanumeric encoding (11 bits per 2 characters)
|-
| 0100 || Byte encoding (8 bits per character)
|-
| 1000 || Kanji encoding (13 bits per character)
|-
| 0011 || Structured append (used to split a message across multiple QR symbols)
|-
| 0111 || [[Extended Channel Interpretation]] (select alternate character set or encoding)
|-
| 0101 || FNC1 in first position (see [[Code 128]] for more information)
|-
| 1001 || FNC1 in second position
|-
| 0000 || End of message
|}

After every indicator that selects an encoding mode is a length field that tells how many characters are encoded in that mode. The number of bits in the length field depends on the encoding and the symbol version.

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Number of bits per length field
! Encoding !! Ver. 1–9 !! 10–26 !! 27–40
|-
! Numeric
| 10 || 12 || 14
|-
! Alphanumeric
| 9 || 11 || 13
|-
! Byte
| 8 || 16 || 16
|-
! Kanji
| 8 || 10 || 12
|}

Alphanumeric encoding mode stores a message more compactly than the byte mode can, but cannot store lower-case letters and has only a limited selection of punctuation marks, which are sufficient for rudimentary [[web address]]es. Two characters are coded in an 11-bit value by this formula:
:V = 45 × C<sub>1</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>

{| class="wikitable"

== Variants ==
<!-- the word "version" is confused in this section; it is used to refer to both symbol sizes and the generation of a specification. -->
''Micro QR code'' is a smaller version of the QR code standard for applications where symbol size is limited. There are 4 different versions (sizes) of Micro QR codes: the smallest is 11×11 modules; the largest can hold 35 numeric characters.<ref>Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture techniques — QR Code 2005 bar code symbology specification, ISO/IEC 18004:2006 cor. 2009, pages 3, 6.</ref>

''IQR code'' is an alternative to existing QR codes developed by Denso Wave. IQR codes can be created in square or rectangular formations; this is intended for situations where a rectangular barcode would otherwise be more appropriate, such as cylindrical objects. IQR codes can fit the same amount of information in 30% less space. There are 61 versions of square IQR codes, and 15 versions of rectangular codes. For squares, the minimum size is 9x9 modules; rectangles have a minimum of 19x5 modules. IQR codes add error correction level S, which allows for 50% error correction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gs1jp.org/pdf/001.pdf#34 |title=QR Code Overview & Progress of QR Code Applications |accessdate=26 June 2014 }}</ref> IQR Codes have not yet been given an ISO specification, and only proprietary Denso Wave products can create or read IQR codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/codes/iqr.html|title=iQR Code - QRcode.com - DENSO WAVE|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2015}}</ref>

''Model 1 QR code'' is an older version of the specification. It is visually similar to the widely seen model 2 codes, but lacks alignment patterns.

== Risks ==

The only context in which common QR codes can carry executable data is the [[URL]] data type.  These URLs may host Javascript code, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in applications on the host system, such as the reader, the web browser or the image viewer, since a reader will typically send the data to the application associated with the data type used by the QR code.

In the case of no software exploits, malicious QR codes combined with a permissive reader can still put a computer's contents and user's privacy at risk. This practice is known as "attagging", a [[portmanteau]] of "attack tagging".<ref name="Wired">{{citation |periodical=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |title=Jargon Watch |page=22 |date=January 2012 |volume=20 |issue=1 }}.</ref> They are easily created and can be affixed over legitimate QR codes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=11305 |title=Malicious Images: What's a QR Code |publisher=SANS Technology Institute |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120713/http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=11305 |archivedate=2012-07-13}}</ref> On a [[smartphone]], the reader's permissions may allow use of the camera, full Internet access, read/write contact data, [[GPS]], read [[web browser|browser]] history, read/write local storage, and global system changes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android |publisher=Google |date=1 June 2011 |title=Barcode Scanner |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://market.android.com/details?id=la.droid.qr |title=QR Droid |publisher=Google |date=19 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/https://market.android.com/details?id=la.droid.qr |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ScanLife |title=ScanLife Barcode Reader |publisher=Google |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ScanLife |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

== Extension ==

Researchers have proposed a new [[High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code|HCC2D]] code, which builds upon a QR code basis for preserving the QR robustness to distortions and use colors for increasing data density (even if at this stage it is still in prototyping phase).
The [[High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code|HCC2D]] code specification is described in details in Querini et al. (2014),<ref name="Querini et al. (2014)">[http://www.tmrfindia.org/ijcsa/v8i19.pdf 2D Color Barcodes for Mobile Phones]</ref> while techniques for color classification of [[High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code|HCC2D]] code cells are descripted in details in Querini and Italiano (2014),<ref name="Querini and Italiano (2014)">[http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1820-0214/2014/1820-02141400054Q.pdf Reliability and data density in high capacity color barcodes]</ref> which is an extended version of Querini and Italiano (2013).<ref name="Querini and Italiano (2013)">[https://fedcsis.org/proceedings/2013/pliks/67.pdf Color classifiers for 2D color barcodes]</ref>

[[File:Hcc2d.png|thumb|Samples of the High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) code: (a) 4-color HCC2D code and (b) 8-color HCC2D code.]]

Introducing colors into QR codes requires addressing additional issues. In particular, during QR code reading only the brightness information is taken into account, while [[High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code|HCC2D]] codes have to cope with chromatic distortions during the decoding phase. In order to ensure adaptation to chromatic distortions which arise in each scanned code, [[High Capacity Colored 2-Dimensional (HCC2D) Code|HCC2D]] codes make use of an additional field: the Color Palette Pattern. This is because color cells of a Color Palette Pattern are supposed to be distorted in the same way as color cells of the Encoding Region. Replicated color palettes are used for training machine learning classifiers.
