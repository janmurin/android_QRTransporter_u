'''QR code''' (abbreviated from '''Quick Response Code''') is the trademark for a type of [[matrix barcode]] (or two-dimensional [[barcode]]) first designed for the [[automotive industry in Japan]]. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte / binary, and [[kanji]]) to efficiently store data; extensions may also be used.<ref name=QRCodefeatures>{{cite web |url=http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrfeature.html |title=QR Code features |publisher=Denso-Wave |accessdate=3 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://archive.is/20120915/http://www.qrcode.com/en/qrfeature.html |archivedate=2012-09-15}}</ref>

The QR Code system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcodes]]. Applications include product tracking, item identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacs.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=D1FpVAvvJuo%3D&tabid=1426&mid=4802 |title=QR Code Essentials |publisher=Denso ADC |year= 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

A QR code consists of black modules (square dots) arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device (such as a camera, scanner, etc.) and processed using [[Reed–Solomon]] error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.<ref name=autogenerated1 />
